# ‚òÄÔ∏è Solar Radiation Data Analysis and Cleaning üå¶Ô∏è

This repository contains the code and documentation for analyzing and cleaning solar radiation datasets from Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo. The project aims to enhance data quality, explore relationships between variables, and provide insights for solar energy applications.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project involves the following key steps:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performing descriptive statistics, visualizing data patterns, and identifying anomalies.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handling negative values, missing values, and outliers to improve data quality.
3. **Visualization and Insights:** Creating informative visualizations (scatter plots, histograms, bubble charts, wind roses) to explore relationships and gain insights.
4. **Correlation Analysis:** Quantifying relationships between variables using correlation matrices and pair plots.
5. **Documentation and Reporting:** Generating a comprehensive report summarizing the analysis and findings.

## üìÇ Dataset Description

The analysis utilizes three datasets containing solar radiation and meteorological measurements:

- **Benin:** `benin-malanville.csv`
- **Sierra Leone:** `sierraleone-bumbuna.csv`
- **Togo:** `togo-dapaong_qc.csv`


## üîç Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing and cleaning solar radiation datasets collected from three West African countries: Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo. The primary goal is to improve the quality and reliability of these datasets, enabling robust assessments of solar energy resources and their potential for various applications.

**Key Objectives:**

- **Data Quality Enhancement:** Identify and address data quality issues such as negative values, missing data, and outliers.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Explore data patterns, distributions, and relationships between variables to gain insights into solar radiation characteristics.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Quantify the relationships between solar radiation, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other meteorological factors.
- **Visualization and Interpretation:** Create informative visualizations (scatter plots, histograms, bubble charts, wind roses) to facilitate understanding and communication of findings.
- **Knowledge Extraction:** Extract valuable insights from the data that can inform decision-making in solar energy applications, including site selection, system design, and resource assessment.

This repository contains the code, documentation, and visualizations generated during the project, offering a transparent and reproducible approach to solar radiation data analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies

- **Python:** Programming language for data analysis and visualization.
- **Pandas:** Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** Library for numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib:** Library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- **Seaborn:** Library for statistical data visualization based on Matplotlib.
- **Windrose:** Library for creating wind rose plots.
- **SciPy:** Library for scientific and technical computing.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This section provides instructions to set up your environment and run the solar radiation data analysis using VS Code.

**Prerequisites:**

- **Python 3.7 or higher:** Make sure you have a compatible version of Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **VS Code:** Install Visual Studio Code from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- **Python Extension for VS Code:** Install the Python extension from the VS Code Marketplace.

**Steps:**

1. **Clone the repository:**

2. **Open the project in VS Code:**
   Open the cloned repository folder (`solar-radiation-analysis`) in VS Code.

3. **Select a Python interpreter:**
   VS Code will automatically detect your Python installation. If you have multiple Python versions, select the desired one by clicking on the Python version displayed in the bottom left corner of the VS Code window.

4. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
   Open the VS Code command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) and search for "Python: Create Environment". Select "Venv" as the environment type and follow the prompts.

5. **Install dependencies:**
   Open the VS Code terminal and run:
   This will install all the necessary Python packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

6. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**
   Open the `Solar_Radiation_Analysis.ipynb` file in VS Code. The Jupyter extension will automatically start a Jupyter server and allow you to run the notebook within VS Code.

7. **Run the code:**
   Execute the code cells in the notebook sequentially to perform the data analysis and cleaning steps. You can run a cell by clicking on the "Run Cell" button or using the keyboard shortcut `Shift + Enter`.

8. **Explore the results:**
   The notebook contains visualizations and outputs that provide insights into the data. You can modify the code, add new cells, and experiment with different analysis techniques directly within VS Code.

**Troubleshooting:**

- If you encounter any issues during installation, make sure you have the correct versions of Python and pip installed.
- If you have problems running the notebook, check that you have selected the correct Python interpreter and that all dependencies are installed correctly.
- For specific errors or questions, please refer to the project documentation or open an issue on GitHub.

We hope this detailed guide helps you get started with the solar radiation data analysis project using VS Code!
